## Deployed App
https://next-best-ballondor.herokuapp.com/


## App Description
The Ballon d'Or is the highest individual honor in football/soccer, recognizing the best players.
Next Best is a full CRUD application that provides the user the ability to view top 5 leagues (because let's be honest, the winner will come from one of these five), all teams in specific league, all players in specific team, and player details in order to predict who they think will win the next coveted Ballon d'Or.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to predict and keep track of who I think will win the next ballon d'or 
- As a user, I want to select who I think are the top nominees
- As a user, once I add a player to my list of nominees, I want to be redirected to my nominees page
- As a user, I want to be able to view the team performances, rankings, player rankings, player statistics/details


## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. In the terminal, run ```npm i``` and install the following packages:
  - ```axios```
  - ```method_override```
  - ```ejs```
  - ```express```
  - ```express-ejsLayouts```
  - ```cookieParser```
  - ```cryptojs```
  - ```bcrypt```
  - ```dotenv```
  - ```pg```
  - ```sequelize```
  - ```sequelize-cli```
3. Open code in desired code editor
4. OPTIONAL: request an API key to utilize more information, but not necessary to do basic/free queries
5. Create a ```.env``` file and copy your API key into the file, like so:

   ```js
   SECRET='i ate ice cream for breakfast'

   PORT=portYoureRunningOn
   ```
   - No need to create and insert an API key if you do not request one, just use the one the API already embeds in the url

  // console.log(url)
  axios.get(url).then((response) => {
    const leagues = [...response.data.leagues]
    const soccerLeagues = []
    leagues.forEach((league) => {
      if (league.idLeague === '4331' || league.idLeague === '4328' || league.idLeague === '4332' || league.idLeague === '4334' || league.idLeague === '4335') {
        soccerLeagues.push(league);
      }
    })
    res.render("leagues/leagues.ejs", {
      soccerLeagues,
      results: leagues
    })
  })
})
```
```js
