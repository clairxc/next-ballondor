  <h3 class="home-h3">The Ultimate Football Individual Award</h3>
  
  <p class="home-p">
    The Ballon d'Or award is the greatest personal accolade a football player can win each season, as the prize will crown them as the best player to have played over the course of a season.
  </p>
  
  <p class="home-p">
    Of course, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have dominated the award proceedings for a number of years, although there have been a number of other individuals who have come close to challenging two of the world's best football players to have ever existed.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="home-h3">How is the Ballon d'Or winner selected?</h3>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      The process of electing a Ballon d'Or winner begins with a shortlist of 30 footballers assembled by the editorial team at France Football.
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      Since 2018, the publication has lined up a 20-player nominee list for the Ballon d'Or Feminin.
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      The jury, consisting of top journalists from around the globe as well as national team coaches and captains, are asked to vote. (It's worth noting that only one journalist per country can cast his/her vote.)
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      The following criteria is taken into consideration for a member of the jury to cast their vote:
      <ol class="home">
        <li>Individual and collective performances (winners) during the year</li>
        <li>Player class (talent and sportsmanship)</li>
        <li>Overall assessment of a player's career</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      Each voter will select their top five players in descending order of merit. The player deemed first in each journalist's selection is awarded six points, the second-placed player gets four points, down to one point for fifth place.
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      The journalists can pick players from their countries, but the captains CANNOT vote for themselves. They, however, can vote for their national or club teammates.
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      The votes are then counted, and the player - with the most points - is declared the winner of the Ballon d'Or award.
    </p>
  
    <p class="home-p">
      In the case of a tie, the player with the most votes in the first place is considered the winner.
